      All my life, I've always been fascinated by tech, as I didn't see it often
      in our household as much back then. I loved whatever magic is working
      behind every electronic device I lay my eyes on. So, growing up, I
      followed tech and always aspired to have a computer of my own at home,
      just like what I usually see in computer shops I'm so fond of. Fast
      forward to today, I am now a Business Analyst at SSCGI, where I get to
      work with tech every day. Although the nature of my job is not as near
      programming and developing as I studied back in college, I'm still keeping
      tabs on the latest trends in software/web development by watching my
      favorite content creators.
