      This is the second iteration of my personal portfolio, still using

      because of its utter beauty and simplicity. Within the previous week, I've
      learned a lot. And unlike last time, I used the assistance of AI to help
      fill in the gaps of my knowledge and understanding of web design,
      especially in JavaScript. Though the complex scripting are for GPT to
      handle, all concepts and design ideas are still as human as the person
      standing in front of you. And I hope you can understand my point here -
      that it's totally fine for you to use AI to help you with your work, but
      the ideas and creativity must remain human.
